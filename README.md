# Array
**An Array consists of a collection of elements (values or variables), each stored and identified by at least one array index or key.**

They are the most commonly used data structure and every programming language supports them as part of the core data structures.

Four operations should be found to operate at least in an array.

- Insertion
- Searching
- Deletion
- Transverse (Print each element in the array one by one)
