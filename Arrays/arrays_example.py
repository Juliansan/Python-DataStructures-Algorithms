integerArray = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]          # A list of 5 integers
charArray = ['a' for j in range(1000)]  # 1,000 letter 'a' characters
booleArray = [False] * 32768            # 32,768 binary False values

# Each of this assignment statements creates a list with specific initial values.

# Â Example Creating an Arrray
maxSize = 10000  # Array size 10000
myArray = [None] * maxSize
myArraySize = 0  # We set size 0 as we would like to count the number of values inserted and not the length of the array

# Accessing List Elements
temp = myArray[3] # get contents from the fourth cell
myArray[7] = 66 # Insert 66 on the eight cell
